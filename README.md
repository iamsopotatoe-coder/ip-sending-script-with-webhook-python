## What's This About?

This is a simple Python script that grabs your machine's current IP address and sends it to a Discord webhook. I built this while learning Python, and it's been a great way to understand how HTTP requests, APIs, and webhooks actually work in practice.

## What It Does

- Automatically detects your IP address
- Sends it to Discord via webhook
- Easy to set up and configure
- Lightweight and runs quickly

## Why I Made This

Honestly, this started as a learning project. I wanted to get hands-on experience with:

- Making requests to external APIs
- Setting up and using webhooks
- Understanding how HTTP requests work in Python
- Just getting better at Python in general

## üìù Please Read (Important)

Hey, just want to be clear about something: **this script is meant for personal learning and testing only.**

Here's the deal:
- Only use this on your own devices and networks
- Don't deploy this to collect information from other people without their knowledge and permission‚Äîthat's not cool and could get you in legal trouble
- You're responsible for how you use this tool, so please be smart and ethical about it
- I'm sharing this for educational purposes and don't take any responsibility if someone uses it inappropriately

Basically, treat this like any other tool: use it responsibly, respect others' privacy, and stay on the right side of the law. If you're testing it, make sure it's on your own stuff.

## Sample Output

Here's what the message looks like when it hits Discord:
